NAME

SOAP::Lite::InstanceExporter.pm


SYNOPSIS

use SOAP::Lite::InstanceExporter qw(bareword_objectname1,..,bareword_objectnameN);


PURPOSE

Allow SOAP objects to persist in the main package namespace on a SOAP server
between client sessions


DESCRIPTION

This class is used to provide a SOAP interface wrapped around
a reference to an object residing in a package namespace on the server.
SOAP objects exported without this wrapper are initialized and destroyed 
on a per session basis.  SOAP::Lite::InstanceExporter allows the server to 
preserve the state of an object in memory across sessions.  Used in conjunction 
with SOAP::Lite object_by_reference feature.
